# Kubernetes-
Kubernetes is a system for managing containerized applications across a cluster of nodes. In simple terms, you have a group of machines (e.g. VMs) and containerized applications (e.g. Dockerized applications), and Kubernetes will help you to easily manage those apps across those machines.
